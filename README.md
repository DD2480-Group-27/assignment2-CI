# Continuous Integration Server
![Generated by Adobe Firefly](./resources/CI_cover.jpg)
## Mission Objective: Streamlining Development

The Continuous Integration Server project automates the building and testing of our group project, then notifying the user of the results through email. By continuously compiling code and performing static syntax checks, we can ensure high code quality and seamless integration.

## Why This CI Server Matters

This CI server enhances the development workflow by automating essential tasks. With real-time feedback triggered by webhooks, developers can quickly identify and resolve issues, leading to a more stable codebase.

## System Requirements

This project requires Java 21 LTS (tested on versions 21.0.1 and 21.0.5).
This project requires ngrok v3 (tested on version 3.19.1).
This project requires Apache Maven 3.9.9.
This project requires an API key for the e-mail service to be defined among the environment variables.

## Running the Server: Instructions

To deploy your Continuous Integration Server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning the project's repository to your local machine.
2. **Build the project**: Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to clean and install the project:
    
    `mvn clean install`
    
3. **Compile the code**: Next, compile the project by executing:
    
    `mvn compile`
    
4. **Run the Java server**: Finally, start the Continuous Integration Server by running:
    
    `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="CIServer"`

5. **Set ngrok authentication token**: After creating a ngrok account, use the command:

    `ngrok config add-authtoken $YOUR_AUTHTOKEN`
   
6. **Start ngrok service**: Make Java server accessible on public Internet using the command:

    `./ngrok http [optional url] [port]`

## Way of working collaboratively (according to Essence)
The team has begun working together after understanding each other's positions and intentions. Everyone has understood the responsibilities that the group and each person has taken on and will collaborate to make sure this is completed on time. Some issues with workload distribution and wasted work are still slowing progress. While trust and commitment exist, the team has yet to fully streamline workflows, minimize redundant work, and ensure seamless integration across all contributions. Until these challenges are addressed, the team remains in a collaborative state but has not yet reached optimal performance.
